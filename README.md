##tempo

#### for teams where tracking work is tricky: check and set your tempo

## SUB-APPS

- agents
  - (team) member
  - non-member ?
- accounts
- users?
- main-container
- nav ?
- grid
  - track ?
  - cell ?

## NOTES

- need html, body, and main to be width / height 100%?
- is there a way to do that with stilr? i.e. have a pre-built CSS string and smush it with the stilr-generated string in server/render.js ?
